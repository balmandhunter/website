                                Why am I a data junkie? Because I'm  excited about getting my hands on the vast reservoir of information that is waiting to be tapped. As scientists and engineers, we spend most of our time acquiring information through research and experimentation. Data science capitalizes on the opportunity to extract information from the mountains of data that have already been collected.

                                I've recently experienced this phenomenon in my work as a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado. My research group develops inexpensive air quality monitors using low-cost sensors, and lately, I've been exploring how machine learning can improve sensor performance. In  a few short months, I have been able to significantly improve the regression models that we use to calibrate our sensors, and therefore improve the accuracy of our measurements- all without spending any time improving instrument design or performing more experiments.

                                The ability of data science to exponentially accelerate the pace of research is very exciting, and can be applied to almost any field. I am eager to explore the hidden possibilities of data, and push the boundaries of understanding.

                    their homes by burning biomass indoors in unvented fireplaces, and

                        <h2> Personal Work - Regression Modeling for Sensor Calibration
                        </h2>



                        <p>
                            I have always valued explanatory data visualization, but the importance of exploratory data visualization has become more apparent to me as I have worked on improving the regression models we use for sensor calibrations. Check out my IPython notebook on <a class = "neutral" href="https://github.com/balmandhunter/Regressions_machine_learning/blob/master/CAMP_calibrations.ipynb">GitHub</a> to see all of the visualizations I used to guide my regression modeling decisions.
                        </p>
                        <img src="img/data3.png" class="img-responsive center-block space max_width" alt="">
                        <p>
                            The plot above is a comparison between the ozone values predicted by a linear regression model, using the data from the low-cost sensors, and the ozone values measured by a reference instrument. The cross-validation root-mean-square error (RMSE) for this model is 6&thinsp;ppb, which means that the mean difference  between the reference ozone concentration measurements and the model predictions is 6&thinsp;ppb.  This RMSE is very good, especially when you consider the fact that we're comparing the performance of a $10 sensor to a $10,000+ reference instrument. However, when you look at this plot, you can see that at high ozone values (>&thinsp;60&thinsp;ppb), the model underpredicts ozone by an average of 10.4 ppb, with an RMSE of 11&thinsp;ppb. Since exposure to high ozone concentrations can negatively impact health, researchers are most concerned about these high ozone values, and it is critical to measure them accurately. Without plotting this data, one could conclude that this model is a great fit, but this plot instantly makes it clear that it does not work well at high values.
                        </p>

                        <img src="img/data10.png" class="img-responsive
                        center-block space max_width" alt=""> <img
                        src="img/data9.png" class="img-responsive center-block
                        space max_width" alt="">
                        <p> You can observe the
                        distribution of the predicted and reference data above.
                        The blue lines represent how the data would look if it
                        were perfectly normally distributed, and looking at the
                        actual data distribution in the bins shows us that the
                        data is close to normally distributed. The top plot
                        represents the distribution of the reference data. There
                        is an abrupt cutoff at a concentration of zero, since
                        ozone concentration cannot be less than zero. Notice
                        that when the ozone concentration is above
                        50&thinsp;ppb, the bins match the normal distribution
                        very closely. The ozone concentration predictions in
                        bottom plot, on the other hand, abruptly drop off around
                        60&thinsp;ppb, and there are no predicted concentrations
                        above 65&thinsp;ppb. </p>

                        center-block space max_width" alt="">

                        <p> To reduce the
                        model's underprediction at high values, I transformed
                        the base features (ozone sensor signal, temperature and
                        humidity) to create 321 new features. The plot above
                        shows a linear regression with all 324 features. Adding
                        the new features to the regression reduced the magnitude
                        of the underprediction from at high values to
                        2.6&thinsp;ppb, and the high-ozone cross-validation RMSE
                        decreased slightly to 10&thinsp;ppb. As expected when
                        adding a large number of features, the variance
                        increased, and the overall RMSE increased from
                        6&thinsp;ppb to 7&thinsp;ppb. Since it is always best to
                        use the simplest model that produces good results, the
                        next step is to try to simplify the model. Reducing the
                        number of features in a model is also one way to reduce
                        variance in the model. </p>

                        <p> I used forward selection to reduce the number of
                        features in the model. I wrote an algorithm that chooses
                        each feature based on minimizing a custom error
                        function. The custom function is: <br><br> </p>

                         The plots above show how the custom error and RMSE change as each next-best feature is added to the regression. The top plot shows the 100 best features, and the bottom plot is zoomed in on the area in the red circle. Based on this data, I will likely select between 33 and 37 features for the model, since both the custom score and overall RMSE are low in this region. In addition to looking at the plots above, I looked at learning curves to evaluate when adding features starts to lead to overfitting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Learning curves visualize how error for a cross-validation set and training set change as the number of training samples increases. When a fit has high bias, the training and cross-validation error converge at high error values. When a fit has high variance, as the number of samples increases, the gap between the training error and cross-validation error remains large. The plot above is a learning curve for a fit that includes all 324 features. You can see that there is a large difference between the training and cross-validation error, which is a sign of high variance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        I plotted a learning curve for each feature that I added to the model. By looking through the curves, and seeing how they change with each feature, you can tell if and when adding more features leads to overfitting. The learning curve above is for the maximum number of features I'm considering (37). The training and cross-validation lines are close together, so the model does not have a variance problem, and including up to 37 features in the model should not lead to overfitting. See my IPython notebook on <a class = "neutral" href="https://github.com/balmandhunter/Regressions_machine_learning/blob/master/CAMP_calibrations.ipynb">GitHub</a> to view the learning curves for the best 100 features.

                        Based on the plots discussed above and the statistical results, I decided to use 36 features for my model. The plot above shows a comparison between the ozone values predicted by a the new linear regression model, and the values measured by the reference instrument. The overall cross-validation RMSE is 4&thinsp;ppb, the high-value RMSE is 6&thinsp;ppb, and the difference in high-value medians is -1.9&thinsp;ppb.

                        Another method for reducing variance is to reduce the number of features in a model (and/or the magnitude of their coefficients) using a shrinkage penalty. The plots above are visualizations that aid in the selection of the shrinkage parameter, lambda, for the <a class = "neutral" href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso/lasso.pdf">lasso</a> reduction method. The higher the value of lambda, the larger the penalty placed on high coefficient values. The top plot visualizes how the coefficients change as lambda is increased, and the bottom plot shows how the custom error function I defined varies with lambda. The optimal lambda value is the one that results in the lowest error. The overall cross-validation RMSE for the Lasso model is 5&thinsp;ppb, the high-value RMSE is 6&thinsp;ppb, and the difference in high-value medians is -3.7&thinsp;ppb. While these statistics are significantly better than the base model, they are not as good as the forward selection results.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Other methods used in this experiment include random forest regressions and support vector machines.The box plots above show the absolute difference in medians between the reference and pod ozone measurements for ambient ozone concentrations higher than 50 ppb. All of the methods shown above outperformed linear regressions with the base features. The box, labeled “Best (FS)” represents the outcomes of a linear regression with the best generated features, extracted using forward-stepwise selection. The “Best Overall” box represents the models determined to be the most accurate (best forward selection for 75% of pods and lasso for 25%). While switching 25% of the pods to the lasso model slightly increases the absolute median difference between the pod and reference measurements, it improved the RMSE for pods that had variance problems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The best results for the cross-validation data were obtained using a linear model with features selected using forward selection with a custom error function. In addition to cross-validation data, it is important to have a true holdout data set, which is not used to choose the best model. For the true holdout data, using the best model, the overall RMSE is 3&thinsp;ppb, the high-value RMSE is 4&thinsp;ppb, and the difference in high-value medians is -2.2&thinsp;ppb.

                        The slopegraph above shows how the difference between the medians of high-ozone values (> 50 ppb) measured by the reference instrument and the pods changes when the regression model is changed from linear with the base features (pod ozone sensor signal, temperature, relative humidity) to a linear model with the best created features.

                        The figure above shows the high ozone-value RMSE for the base features and best features. The high ozone-value RMSE is reduced in 15 of the 16 pods. The median high ozone-value RMSE for the linear model with base features is 6 ppb, with a standard deviation of 3.7 ppb. The median and standard deviation of the RMSE values are reduced to 4 ppb and 1.1 ppb, respectively, when the best models are used.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The emphasis on improvements in the fit at high values did not lead to a less accurate model at lower values, as shown in the bar graph above. The change in model reduced the overall RMSE in 15 of the 16 pods. The median overall RMSE was reduced from 6 ppb to 5 ppb, and the standard deviation was reduced from 2.5 ppb to 1.6 ppb.
