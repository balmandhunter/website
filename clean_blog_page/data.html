                                Why am I a data junkie? Because I'm  excited about getting my hands on the vast reservoiur of information out there that is waiting to be tapped. As scientists and engineers, we spend most of our time acquiring information through research and experimentation. Data science capitalizes on the serendipitous opportunity to extract information from the mountains of data that have already been collected. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've recently experienced this phenomenon in my work as a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado. My research group develops inexpensive air quality monitors using low-cost sensors, and lately, I've been exploring how machine learning can improve sensor performance. In  a few short months, I have been able to significantly improve the regression models that we use to calibrate our sensors, and therefore greatly improve the accuracy of our measurements- all without spending any time improving instrument design or performing more experiments. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ability of data science to exponentially accelerate the pace of research is alluring, and can be applied to almost any field. I am eager to explore the hidden possibilities of data, and push the boundaries of understanding.

                            I'm intrigued by data visualization. I believe that superb visualizations represent an intersection between art, science and education. The article, below, explains how even simple data visualiztions can provide a wealth of information:
